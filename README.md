# Rust-Learn
Little programs to start to know rust better, mainly algorithms of searching and sorting

##Algorithms made to this date:
###-Binary Search
--On a sorted Array, search a value through the average position between a max and min value.
--Time complexity: O(log(n))
--Memory complexity: The algorithm uses no auxiliar memory, so it is O(1)

###-Bubble Sort

###-Insertion Sort

###-Linear Search

##Algorithms I still want to grasp and try to implement here
-Merge Sort
-Quick Sort
-Tree Structures
